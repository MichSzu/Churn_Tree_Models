# Churn_Tree_Models
Data Science project in which I performe exploratory data analysis on given data and create 4 different ML models. The main idea behind that project is to predict if a certain user with bunch of features will extend his contract with a company after expiring.

Models created in that project:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost
- Gradient Boost
